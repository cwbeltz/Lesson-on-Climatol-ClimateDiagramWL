# Walter-Lieth Climate Diagrams using `climatol`
This is a help file for creating Walter-Lieth climate diagrams in R using the `climatol` package. Walter-Lieth diagrams are used to summarize long-term monthly climate variables over the course of the year.

The code and associated files were originally created for a short, 3-hour workshop on creating climate diagrams for a class on Global Drylands at Yale University.
